Was this the face that launched a thousand ships	
And burnt the topless 2 towers of Ilium?	
Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss.
Her lips suck forth my soul; see where it flies!—	
Come, Helen, come, give me my soul again.	
Here will I dwell, for Heaven is in these lips,	
And all is dross that is not Helena.  Enter OLD MAN.	
I will be Paris, and for love of thee,
Instead of Troy, shall Wittenberg be sack’d;	
And I will combat with weak Menelaus,	
And wear thy colours on my plumed crest;	
Yea, I will wound Achilles in the heel,	
And then return to Helen for a kiss.
Oh, thou art fairer than the evening air	
Clad in the beauty of a thousand stars;	
Brighter art thou than flaming Jupiter	
When he appear’d to hapless Semele:	
More lovely than the monarch of the sky
In wanton Arethusa’s azured arms:	
And none but thou shalt be my paramour.
